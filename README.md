CyberSecure is a **real-time Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** that classifies network traffic as **Benign** or **Intrusion**, assigns a **confidence score**, and automatically recommends **security response actions**.  
Built using a **high-recall ML model**, this system ensures **no intrusion goes undetected**, enabling fast and intelligent SOC triage.

> ❗ In cybersecurity, missing a single attack can be catastrophic.  
> That’s why **Intrusion Recall** is our top priority metric.

## 🎯 Hackathon Problem Statement — REDACT (PS-02)

**Goal:** Build an ML-based IDS using tabular network flow features to detect malicious behavior and automate action-based triage.

Implemented requirements:
- ✔ Binary classification: Intrusion vs Benign  
- ✔ Confidence Score + Automated Security Actions  
- ✔ Live Dashboard for SOC triage  
- ✔ High Recall optimization  
- ✔ Tamper-proof Blockchain Logging *(Bonus)*  
- ✔ Explainable AI *(Bonus)*  

**100% features + bonuses delivered 🎯🔥**

- **Live Threat Feed**
- **Blockchain Ledger Viewer**
- **Metrics Dashboard**
- **Explainability Insights**
---
## ▶️ How to Run the Application (Launcher Script Version)

Follow the steps below to launch the CyberSecure — IDS Dashboard:

---

### 1️⃣ Download & Extract
- Download the project ZIP from the GitHub Releases section
- Extract the ZIP into any folder on your system

---

### 2️⃣ Install Required Python Dependencies
Open a terminal (CMD / PowerShell / Terminal) inside the extracted folder:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
---
### 3️⃣ Launch the Application

Inside the main project directory, run:
```bash
python launcher.py
```
This will automatically launch the Streamlit dashboard in your browser at:
```bash
http://localhost:8501/

```
---
### 4️⃣ Upload Network Flow Data

Inside the dashboard UI:

✔ Upload included demo datasets (inputs.csv)
or
✔ Upload your own CSV file with the same feature format and rename to inputs.csv

---
## ⛓️ Blockchain-Backed Intrusion Ledger

Our IDS includes a **lightweight custom blockchain** that provides tamper-evident storage for all detected intrusions.  
It is designed specifically for **incident forensics**, **traceability**, and **data integrity assurance**.

---

### 🔧 How It Works

When you run **`launcher.py`**, the following sequence occurs:

1. **`predict_offline.py` runs first**  
   - It checks whether a `chain.json` file already exists in the project directory.  
   - If **no chain exists**, it **creates a new blockchain** and appends a block for every flow in `inputs.csv`.  
   - If a **chain already exists**, it **appends new intrusion blocks** to the existing chain — preserving all previous entries.

2. After predictions finish, **`app.py` starts the Streamlit dashboard**, where users can:
   - View the blockchain contents  
   - Monitor newly added intrusion records  
   - Verify chain integrity  

---

### 🔗 What Each Blockchain Block Contains

Every intrusion is stored as a block containing:

- The model’s verdict (Benign/Intrusion)  
- Intrusion probability & confidence  
- SHA-256 hash of the flow’s features  
- Hash of the previous block  
- Timestamp of the event  
- A small summary of the most important features  
- The block’s final hash (ensuring immutability)  

This creates a **hash-linked ledger**, where each block depends on all previous blocks.

---

### 🔒 Integrity & Tamper Detection

Our blockchain is **fully self-verifying**:

- The GUI includes a **Verify Chain** button connected to `verify_chain.py`  
- It recomputes hashes for every block and checks the entire chain end-to-end  
- If **any external modification** is made — even a single digit in `chain.json`:
  - The chain is immediately flagged as **INVALID**  
  - The system reports the **exact block index** where integrity fails  
  - No new blocks will be appended until the chain is fixed  

This guarantees **forensic-level data integrity**, ideal for SOC environments.

---

### 🔁 Behavior on Multiple Runs

Running **`launcher.py`** multiple times will:

- Keep using the existing `chain.json`  
- Append new blocks for new flows  
- Grow the chain continuously over time  

This enables **long-term accumulation of intrusion history** and helps build a complete audit trail for network security analysis.

CyberSecure is a **real-time Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** that classifies network traffic as **Benign** or **Intrusion**, assigns a **confidence score**, and automatically recommends **security response actions**.  
Built using a **high-recall ML model**, this system ensures **no intrusion goes undetected**, enabling fast and intelligent SOC triage.

> ❗ In cybersecurity, missing a single attack can be catastrophic.  
> That’s why **Intrusion Recall** is our top priority metric.

## 🎯 Hackathon Problem Statement — REDACT (PS-02)

**Goal:** Build an ML-based IDS using tabular network flow features to detect malicious behavior and automate action-based triage.

Implemented requirements:
- ✔ Binary classification: Intrusion vs Benign  
- ✔ Confidence Score + Automated Security Actions  
- ✔ Live Dashboard for SOC triage  
- ✔ High Recall optimization  
- ✔ Tamper-proof Blockchain Logging *(Bonus)*  
- ✔ Explainable AI *(Bonus)*  

**100% features + bonuses delivered 🎯🔥**

## 🔐 Automated Security Action Logic

| Confidence % | Classification | Security Action |
|-------------|----------------|----------------|
| > 90% | Intrusion | 🚫 Block Source IP |
| 60–90% | Intrusion | ⚠️ Throttle Traffic |
| < 60% | Intrusion | 🕵️ Quarantine Endpoint |
| Any | Benign | ☑ Allow |

Mimics SOC Tier-1 triage decisions.

## ▶️ How to Run the Application (Launcher Script Version)

Follow the steps below to launch the CyberSecure — IDS Dashboard:

---

### 1️⃣ Download & Extract
- Download the project ZIP from the GitHub Releases section
- Extract the ZIP into any folder on your system

---

### 2️⃣ Install Required Python Dependencies
Open a terminal (CMD / PowerShell / Terminal) inside the extracted folder:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
---
### 3️⃣ Launch the Application

Inside the main project directory, run:
```bash
python launcher.py
```
This will automatically launch the Streamlit dashboard in your browser at:
```bash
http://localhost:8501/

```
---
### 4️⃣ Upload Network Flow Data

Inside the dashboard UI:

✔ Upload included demo datasets (inputs.csv)
or
✔ Upload your own CSV file with the same feature format and rename to inputs.csv

---
##⛓️ Blockchain-Based Intrusion Ledger (Bonus)

Each detected intrusion is:

Hashed using SHA-256

Linked with previous block hash

Stored in chain.json

Tampering = Immediate integrity break
→ Supports cyber forensics

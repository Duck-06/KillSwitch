CyberSecure is a **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** that classifies network traffic as **Benign** or **Intrusion**, assigns a **confidence score**, and automatically recommends **security response actions**.  
Built using a **high-recall ML model**, this system ensures **no intrusion goes undetected**, enabling fast and intelligent SOC triage.

> ❗ In cybersecurity, missing a single attack can be catastrophic.  
> That’s why **Intrusion Recall** is our top priority metric.

## ▶️ How to Run the Application (Launcher Script Version)

Follow the steps below to launch the CyberSecure — IDS Dashboard:

---

### 1️⃣ Download & Extract
- Download the project ZIP from the GitHub Releases section
- Extract the ZIP into any folder on your system

---

### 2️⃣ Install Required Python Dependencies
Open a terminal (CMD / PowerShell / Terminal) inside the extracted folder:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
---
### 3️⃣ Launch the Application

Inside the main project directory, run:
```bash
python launcher.py
```
This will automatically launch the Streamlit dashboard in your browser at:
```bash
http://localhost:8501/

```
---
### 4️⃣ Upload Network Flow Data

Inside the dashboard UI:

✔ Upload included demo datasets (inputs.csv)
or
✔ Upload your own CSV file with the same feature format and rename to inputs.csv

---
## ⛓️ Blockchain-Backed Intrusion Ledger

Our IDS includes a **lightweight custom blockchain** that provides tamper-evident storage for all detected intrusions.  
It is designed specifically for **incident forensics**, **traceability**, and **data integrity assurance**.

---

### 🔧 How It Works

When you run **`launcher.py`**, the following sequence occurs:

1. **`predict_offline.py` runs first**  
   - It checks whether a `chain.json` file already exists in the project directory.  
   - If **no chain exists**, it **creates a new blockchain** and appends a block for every flow in `inputs.csv`.  
   - If a **chain already exists**, it **appends new intrusion blocks** to the existing chain — preserving all previous entries.

2. After predictions finish, **`app.py` starts the Streamlit dashboard**, where users can:
   - View the blockchain contents  
   - Monitor newly added intrusion records  
   - Verify chain integrity  

---

### 🔗 What Each Blockchain Block Contains

Every intrusion is stored as a block containing:

- The model’s verdict (Benign/Intrusion)  
- Intrusion probability & confidence  
- SHA-256 hash of the flow’s features  
- Hash of the previous block  
- Timestamp of the event  
- A small summary of the most important features  
- The block’s final hash (ensuring immutability)  

This creates a **hash-linked ledger**, where each block depends on all previous blocks.

---

### 🔒 Integrity & Tamper Detection

Our blockchain is **fully self-verifying**:

- The GUI includes a **Verify Chain** button connected to `verify_chain.py`  
- It recomputes hashes for every block and checks the entire chain end-to-end  
- If **any external modification** is made — even a single digit in `chain.json`:
  - The chain is immediately flagged as **INVALID**  
  - The system reports the **exact block index** where integrity fails  
  - No new blocks will be appended until the chain is fixed  

This guarantees **forensic-level data integrity**, ideal for SOC environments.

---

### 🔁 Behavior on Multiple Runs

Running **`launcher.py`** multiple times will:

- Keep using the existing `chain.json`  
- Append new blocks for new flows  
- Grow the chain continuously over time  

This enables **long-term accumulation of intrusion history** and helps build a complete audit trail for network security analysis.

---
## 🧠 Explainable AI (XAI) for Transparent Intrusion Decisions

Machine Learning models—especially ensemble methods like XGBoost—often work as **black boxes**, making it difficult for analysts to understand *why* a network flow was flagged as malicious.  
To solve this, our IDS integrates **Explainable AI (XAI)** techniques that bring full transparency to every prediction.

---

### 🔍 Why XAI Is Required in an IDS

Traditional IDS models provide a label (Benign/Intrusion) but fail to answer:

- *Which network features triggered the alert?*  
- *Is this a genuine threat or a false alarm?*  
- *Should the SOC operator escalate, ignore, or investigate further?*  
- *What pattern or behaviour caused the model to classify it as malicious?*

Without explainability, ML-based IDS systems risk becoming **untrusted**, **opaque**, and **difficult to audit**.

XAI solves this by providing **clear, human-interpretable explanations** for every decision, enabling:

- Faster triage during real-time investigation  
- Higher operator trust in the ML model  
- Easier debugging and model improvement  
- Stronger forensic traceability alongside the blockchain ledger  

---

### 🛠️ How XAI Is Implemented in This Project

Our XAI layer uses two major components:

#### **1. SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations)**
- Provides **per-flow explanations**, showing which features increased or decreased the chance of an intrusion.  
- Generates **force plots & waterfall charts** that visually break down the model's reasoning.  
- Helps analysts understand feature contributions such as:  
  - Flow Duration  
  - Packet Length Variance  
  - Flag Counts  
  - Flow IAT statistics  
  - Header lengths  
- SHAP values reveal *why* the model makes a decision—not just *what* it predicts.

#### **2. Global Feature Importance**
- Gives an overview of which features the model relies on the most across the entire dataset.  
- Helps in optimizing feature engineering and model tuning.  
- Reflects long-term trends in malicious network behaviour.

---

### 🎯 Outcome

By combining **SHAP explainability** with the **Blockchain-based Intrusion Ledger**, the system provides:

- Transparent, trustworthy intrusion decisions  
- Forensic-grade auditability  
- Actionable insights for SOC analysts  
- A clear rationale for every alert  

This XAI integration transforms the IDS from a black-box classifier into a **fully interpretable, analyst-friendly security system**.
